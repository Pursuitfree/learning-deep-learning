# 3.1 Random Varibles
A random varible is a varible that can take on different values randomly.
For example,
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_{1}" title="x_{1}" /></a> 
and 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?x_{2}" title="x_{2}" /></a>
are both values that the random varible x can take on.
For vector-valued varibles, we would write the random varible as **x** and one of its values as ***x***.


# 3.2 Probability Distribution
A probability distribution is a description of how likely a random varible of a set of varibles is to take on each of its possible states.


## 3.2.1 Discrete Varibles and Probability Mass Functions
PMF(*probability mass function*) is used to describe the probabilty distribion over discrete varibles, denoted typically
by ***P***.
## 3.3.2 Continuous Variables and Probability Density Functions
PDF(*probability density function*) is used to describe the probabilty distribution over continuous varibles and usually 
denoted by <img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p" title="p" /></a>.
A probability density function 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p(x)" title="p(x)" /></a>
does not give the probability of a specific state directly,instead the probability of landing inside infinitesimal
region with volume 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\delta&space;x" title="\delta x" /></a>
is given by 
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p(x)\delta&space;x" title="p(x)\delta x" /></a>.


# 3.4 Maginal Probability
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?P(\mathbf{x}=x)=\sum_{y}P(\mathbf{x}=x,\mathbf{y}=y)" title="P(\mathbf{x}=x)=\sum_{y}P(\mathbf{x}=x,\mathbf{y}=y)" />
<img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?p(x)=\int&space;p(x,y)dy" title="p(x)=\int p(x,y)dy" /></a>
